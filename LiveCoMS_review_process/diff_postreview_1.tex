%Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words. Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.

The ability to predict transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, viscosity, and conductivity) is one of the primary benefits of molecular simulation. Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force field (i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the model). By contrast, the reliability of different simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend is a valid representation of the force field implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures).

There are two classes by which transport properties are predicted: equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). This manuscript presents the best practices for EMD, leaving NEMD for a future publication. As self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are the most prevalent transport properties found in the literature, the discussion will also be limited to these properties with the expectation that future publications will discuss best practices for thermal conductivity, ionic conductivity, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{transport }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multicomponent }\DIFaddend diffusivity.

\section{Introduction}

Transport properties describe the rates at which mass, momentum, heat or charge move through a given substance. They involve \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mean squared displacements (MSDs}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the mean squared displacement (MSD}\DIFaddend ) of molecules as the system evolves dynamically. In general, these properties can be computed by equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) or by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods. The EMD methods involve post-processing of a standard molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory while NEMD methods require modifications of the underlying equations of motion and/or boundary conditions of the system. Therefore, one advantage of EMD is that multiple transport properties can be obtained from a single simulation, whereas NEMD requires a separate simulation for each transport property of interest.

Some molecular simulation packages include built-in post-simulation analysis tools that automatically estimate transport properties from an EMD or NEMD simulation (e.g., Refs. \cite{LAMMPS,GROMACS,AMBER2018,NAMD,Brooks2009,ms2}). In addition, several stand-alone trajectory analysis tools are available which are intended to be simulation code agnostic (e.g., Refs. \cite{Roe2013,MDTraj,VMD}). However, there are often insufficient checks as to whether the actual underlying simulations are adequate for making these estimates. For this reason, we strongly discourage using these analysis tools as a ``black box,'' as no amount of post-processing can compensate for a poorly designed simulation. Following best practices for both the molecular simulation set-up and data analysis is imperative to ensure that meaningful predictions are obtained. The purpose of this document is to improve the quality of published results and to reduce the time required for a novice in the field to obtain meaningful and reliable results.

In addition to the present manuscript, we highly recommend reviewing this list of existing resources:

Most textbooks and class notes provide a thorough discussion of EMD/NEMD theory with little discussion of practical considerations. Review articles tend to focus on the numerical advantages and disadvantages of different methods but assume that the reader already understands the subtleties of implementing each method. Furthermore, although software manuals describe some of the theory and implementation of these methods in their respective environments, the documentation is typically insufficient for someone not familiar with best practices for estimating transport properties. This document supplements the existing literature by providing a succinct checklist and discussing common pitfalls. We also provide some suggestions and recommendations based on our own experience, but ultimately it is up to the individual researcher to test and validate their methods.

\section{Equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) for estimating transport properties}

It is most convenient to consider compiling the transport properties as an implicit part of any equilibrium MD simulation. The added computational overhead is relatively small, especially for the self-diffusivity. The main caveat is that longer simulations than normal may be required to achieve reasonable averages.

The general formula for computing a transport property via an EMD simulation is given as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Green-Kubo}
\gamma = \int_{0}^{\infty}dt\langle\dot{\xi}(t)\dot{\xi}(0)\rangle
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the transport coefficient (within a multiplicative constant), $\xi$ is the mechanical variable associated with the particular transport property under consideration, and $\dot{\xi}$ signifies a time derivative. Integrals of the form given by Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} are known as “Green-Kubo” integrals. It is trivial to show that an integrated form of Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} results in an equivalent expression for $\gamma$ known as the “Einstein” formula

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Einstein}
\gamma = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{\langle (\xi(t)-\xi(0))^2 \rangle}{2t} = \frac{1}{2} \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{d}{dt} \langle (\xi(t)-\xi(0))^2 \rangle
\end{equation}
where the derivative form is often preferred.

For self-diffusivity, $\xi$ is the Cartesian atom position $(r_{\alpha})$ and the time correlation function, $\dot{\xi}$, in Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} is of the molecular velocities $(v_{\alpha})$. For shear viscosity, the integral in Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} is of the time correlation of the off-diagonal elements of the stress tensor. For thermal conductivity, the integral is over the energy current, and for ionic conductivity, the integral is over the ionic current. Table \ref{tab:EMD_equations} provides the relevant equations for self-diffusivity $(D)$ and shear viscosity $(\eta)$, as these properties are the focus of this work.

% The relevant equations for self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are provided in Table \ref{tab:EMD_equations}.

Although both Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} (Green-Kubo) and Equation \ref{eq:Einstein} (Einstein) are theoretically rigorous, in practice one method is often preferred depending on the property being estimated. In the case of self-diffusivity, we recommend the Einstein (MSD) approach. In contrast, for shear viscosity we typically recommend Green-Kubo, although for some systems the Einstein approach may be preferable. As the simulation set-up and computational cost are essentially the same for the Green-Kubo and Einstein approaches, the primary difference is the post-simulation data analysis required. Precision and reproducibility of the estimated value are key factors for selecting between the Green-Kubo or Einstein methods. For this reason, we emphasize the importance of proper and clearly communicated data analysis and rigorous uncertainty quantification.

\DIFaddend \section{General transport checklist items} \label{sec:General}

\subsection{General transport: Simulation set-up} \label{sec:General Simulation Setup}

\subsubsection{Correct ensemble} \label{sec:General: Correct Ensemble}

For a liquid solution, it is safest to run in the microcanonical ($NVE$: constant number of molecules, volume, energy) ensemble, rather than the canonical ($NVT$: constant number of molecules, volume, temperature) or isothermal--isobaric ($NPT$: constant number of molecules, pressure, temperature) ensembles. This is because thermostats required to maintain constant temperature and barostats required to maintain constant pressure can interfere with the dynamics of the system, and thus the resulting transport properties can be skewed. However, it is most common to desire $D$ and $\eta$ at a specified temperature $(T)$ and pressure $(P)$. This requires performing a series of simulations in different ensembles:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $NPT$ ensemble at desired $T$ and $P$ until the system density has properly equilibrated
	\item $NVT$ ensemble where the volume is set such that the density is the average density computed from the $NPT$ run
	\item $NVE$ ensemble where the final configuration of the $NVT$ run is used as the initial configuration
\end{enumerate}
% Do we really just want the last configuration? Should we randomly select a configuration from production? Or a few configurations to run in parallel? Or somehow find an "average" configuration? My concern is just, what if the last configuration happens to be a higher energy sample (or lower probability if coming at it from a Monte Carlo point of view)? -ramess101
It is important that each step consist of both an equilibration and production period. The average pressure and temperature for the $NVE$ production run are computed and should be close to the input $P$ and $T$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend the original $NPT$ run (although it is typical to observe some deviation between the average and prescribed values of $P$ and $T$). These average pressures and temperatures must be reported along with the self-diffusivity and/or viscosity.

%The user should generate multiple starting states that can be used to determine error estimation (see item \ref{item:uncertainty}).

Note that, although the best practice is to use the $NVE$ ensemble (Steps 1 to 3), it is common to see values reported using the $NPT$ ensemble (just Step 1) or $NVT$ ensemble (Steps 1 and 2). We strongly discourage the use of the $NPT$ ensemble alone, because barostats (which alter positions through volume changes) greatly affect the dynamics of a system. In contrast, the $NVT$ ensemble has been implemented successfully for transport property calculations and is quite common, especially for viscosity. For example, Fanourgakis \textit{et al.} reported that the $NVT$ and $NVE$ ensembles provide nearly identical results for viscosity \cite{Fanourgakis2012}. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend A study by Basconi and Shirts \cite{Shirts2013} reached a similar conclusion, and provides guidelines for how thermostats should be applied when computing transport properties. To summarize their results, $NVE$ ensemble estimates for $D$ and $\eta$ are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by $NVT$ simulations with velocity-scaling thermostats (e.g., Berendsen \cite{Berendsen1984}, stochastic rescaling \cite{Bussi2007}, and Nos{\'e}-Hoover \cite{Nose1984} thermostats) and a wide range of thermostat coupling strengths (e.g., time constants of 0.1, 1, and 10 ps, where stronger coupling is achieved with a smaller time constant). By contrast, velocity-randomizing algorithms (e.g., Andersen thermostat \cite{Andersen1980} and Langevin dynamics \cite{Hess2008}) with strong coupling (time constants of 0.1 and 1 ps) dramatically decrease $D$ and increase $\eta$ relative to the $NVE$ ensemble values. Therefore, we recommend using either the $NVT$ or $NVE$ ensemble, with $NVE$ being preferred. If $NVT$ simulations are used, we recommend judiciously selecting the thermostat and coupling strength by consulting Refs. \cite{Fanourgakis2012,Shirts2013}.

% provide $D$ and $\eta$ values that are statistically indistinguishable from the $NVE$ ensemble estimates.

%Furthermore, although most studies use the average density in Step 2, it is important to consider the uncertainty in $D$ or $\eta$ that arises from the uncertainty in $\rho$. Although it is not common to account for this source of uncertainty, we recommend %RAM: This issue is not as important as long as you report the uncertainty in P and/or T in your final simulation.

 %Although this may be the best practice, it appears to me that a large number of practitioners run their production simulations in the $NPT$ ensemble. Should we point this out? I.e. should we say something like "although it is common to see values reported from the $NPT$ ensemble..."? That way the reader will know why our recommendation seems to differ from what they find in the literature. -ramess101
% What about for the gas phase? -RAM

\subsubsection{Replicate simulations} \label{sec:General: Replicate simulations}

To smooth noise in the Green-Kubo integral or Einstein slope, we recommend generating independent replicate trajectories (i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend different initial configurations or random seed to initialize velocities). The primary advantage of performing replicates as opposed to one longer simulation is the computational speed-up. Figure 2 in Ref. \cite{Payal2012} demonstrates that an average of 10 short replicate simulations converges to the same value as a single long simulation. Since these replicates can be performed in parallel, the time required to obtain the result is reduced, although the CPU time may be the same or more.

%\begin{figure}[htb!]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{PayalFig2.png}
%	\caption{Green-Kubo viscosity plot. Copied from Figure 2 of Ref.\ \cite{Payal2012}. Red curve represents the average viscosity over 10 independent 2 ns trajectories whereas the blue curve is obtained from a single 4 ns simulation. For further details, see Ref. \cite{Payal2012}. {\bf Note: When I went to Taylor and Francis to request re-use of this figure, they asked for 315 dollars. I think we need a substitute.}}
%	\label{fig:PayalFig2}
%\end{figure}

The uncertainty (specifically, the standard error of the mean) is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of replicates (see Figure 7 of Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} and Figure 8 of Ref. \cite{Ma2017}). Therefore, increasing the number of replicates is a simple, fast, and direct way to reduce the uncertainty. For example, the fluctuations in $\eta$ are much smaller for the average of 10 replicates compared to that of a single longer simulation (see Figure 2 of Ref. \cite{Payal2012}). As fluctuations in $\eta$ are typically much larger than $D$, more replicate simulations are required for estimating viscosity (see Sec.\ \ref{sec:Viscosity:General: Improved precision}).

In addition, replicate simulations are useful if a single simulation does not adequately sample phase space, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend is trapped in a local minimum or has slow dynamics. Furthermore, replicates can provide rigorous estimates of uncertainty (see Sec.\ \ref{sec:General: Uncertainty}).

Note that, although the best practice is to start each independent replicate at the $NPT$ step, it is common to use the same density ($NVT$ step) for each replicate. This approach is acceptable assuming that the authors provide the corresponding uncertainty in $P$ (see Sec.\ \ref{sec:General Simulation Setup}).

%\item Averaging over multiple simulations with analytic fitting of integral provides a good way of smoothing noise and provides an objective means of determining the viscosity \cite{Zhang2015}.
% I think this point of averaging multiple simulations is important enough to merit its' own discussion


\subsection{General transport: Post-simulation analysis} \label{sec:General: Post-simulation}

\subsubsection{Improved precision} \label{sec:General: Improve precision}

In practice, several tricks-of-the-trade are employed to reduce fluctuations and, thereby, the standard deviation $(\sigma)$. For self-diffusivity, it is a standard practice to average the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mean-square-displacement }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mean squared displacement }\DIFaddend or velocity autocorrelation function over all $N$ molecules (see Table \ref{tab:EMD_equations}). For shear viscosity, it is not possible to average over the number of molecules because viscosity is a collective property that depends on the pressure/stress tensor of the system. For this reason, it is much easier to get precise diffusivity estimates than it is to get precise viscosity estimates; additional tactics are typically employed to improve the viscosity precision, namely, large numbers of replicate simulations.

The self-diffusivity is a tensor, and it is common practice in homogeneous systems to average the diagonal components, such that $D = \frac{1}{3} (D_{xx} + D_{yy} + D_{zz})$ where for example $ D_{xx}=\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{d}{dt} \left\langle \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |x_i(t)-x_i(0)|^2 \right\rangle$. Since formally $D_{xx}=D_{yy}=D_{zz}$ for homogeneous systems, one can test the equivalence of the three terms as a check on a simulation and even to make a crude estimate of the uncertainty in $D$. In inhomogeneous systems, the diagonal terms will not necessarily be equivalent. Off diagonal terms should be zero, and we encourage the user to verify this.

For viscosity, the recommended practice is to use multiple components from the pressure/stress tensor. For example, although early studies only implemented a single off-diagonal component (typically $xy$), the common practice in recent studies is to use all three off-diagonal ($xy$, $yz$, $xz$) and sometimes three additional modified diagonal terms of the pressure/stress tensor (see Sec.\ \ref{sec:Viscosity:General: Improved precision}).

Finally, for both self-diffusivity and shear viscosity it is common to average over multiple time origins $(t_0)$. It is important that the difference between subsequent $t_0$ values $(\delta t_0)$ be longer than the correlation time so that the different time intervals are independent.

\subsubsection{Clear communication} \label{sec:General: Clear communication}

Transport properties are estimated by integration of Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} or calculating the slope of Equation \ref{eq:Einstein} with respect to time. Both methods involve some judgment on the part of the user and results can vary depending on where the slope is taken (Einstein approach) and for how long the integral is carried out (Green-Kubo approach). Some recent work has suggested some guidelines for how to compute an objective estimate of the viscosity using the Green-Kubo approach \cite{Zhang2015}. Similar methods for estimating other transport properties from Equations \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} or \ref{eq:Einstein} should be possible to develop. 

As no single best practice can be recommended for the region over which the slope or integral is calculated, it is important to justify how this decision was made and then clearly communicate the approach used in any publication. Furthermore, it is critical to quantify the degree of variability in the estimated property that arises from assumptions in the data analysis, e.g., the time interval over which the Einstein slope is computed. As post-simulation analysis is an essential step for estimating transport properties, we recommend providing data analysis scripts as supporting information to improve future reproducability.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty quantification} \label{sec:General: Uncertainty}

Providing meaningful estimates of uncertainty is a pivotal, but often overlooked, step in reporting molecular simulation results. For this reason, in addition to the discussion provided below, we recommend a close study of Refs. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citenum{GUM,Grossfield2018}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GUM} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Grossfield2018}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Although force field deficiencies can lead to large systematic deviations with respect to the ``true'' experimental value, we limit our discussion to random uncertainties associated with fluctuations in the simulation output.

Replicates can provide a rigorous uncertainty assessment. We recommend bootstrapping the uncertainties by randomly sampling which replicates are included in the data analysis procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Randomly select (with replacement) a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subset }\DIFaddend of replicate simulations \label{item:Random selection}
	\item Calculate the relevant average quantity from this random set, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend $\langle\dot{\xi}(t)\dot{\xi}(0)\rangle$ for Green-Kubo or $\langle (\xi(t)-\xi(0))^2 \rangle$ for Einstein
	\item Compute transport property $(\gamma)$ from Equations \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} or \ref{eq:Einstein}
	\item Repeat steps 1 through 3 several hundred times \label{item:Loop}
	\item Generate distribution of the estimated values for $D$ or $\eta$ \label{item:Bootstrap Distribution}
	\item Determine lower and upper uncertainty bounds of $D$ or $\eta$ at desired confidence level, $1-\alpha$ \label{item:Confidence interval}
\end{enumerate}
In step \ref{item:Random selection}, the resampled set should be the same size as the original set of replicates, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend $N_{\rm boots} = N_{\rm reps}$. For this reason, replacement after each random selection is key to ensure that a different set is resampled for each cycle (step \ref{item:Loop}). Note that this approach is typically most reliable when $N_{\rm reps} \ge 20$. However, we recommend this approach even if only a few replicate simulations are performed to at least have a rough estimate of the uncertainty.

Step \ref{item:Confidence interval} requires the probability density function (PDF, or alternatively the cumulative distribution function, CDF) for $D$ or $\eta$. The bootstrapped distribution of $D$ or $\eta$ obtained in Step \ref{item:Bootstrap Distribution} is used to approximate the PDF, which is typically expressed as either a histogram or by fitting to a normal distribution. Solving for the lower and upper bounds of $D$ or $\eta$ can be performed in several different ways, but the two-sided tail approach is most common. With this approach, the lower and upper bounds correspond to the values that yield $\alpha/2 \times 100$~\% of the integrated PDF in the lower and upper tails. We recommend using $\alpha = 0.05$, corresponding to a 95~\% confidence interval.

%Compute statistical uncertainty by running independent replicates (using multiple starting states from $NPT$ run at desired temperature) and taking the standard deviation (what do the uncertainty people say?) How many replicates do we recommend? \label{item:uncertainty}
%
%Independent simulations should be run and each integral can be averaged together to obtain a smoothed integral. With these replicate simulations, we recommend that the uncertainty be determined using a bootstrap methodology:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Randomly selecting (with replacement) from the set of replicate simulations
%	\item Calculating the average integral from this random set
%	\item Computing the self-diffusivity
%	\item Repeat steps a)-c) thousands of times
%	\item Generate distribution of the estimated values of self-diffusivity
%	\item Compute uncertainty by integrating distribution at desired confidence level
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{General transport: Common pitfalls} \label{sec:General: Common pitfalls}

When simulating in the $NVE$ ensemble, it is imperative that the integrator conserve energy. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Performing simulations with single precision is one of the main causes for poor conservation of energy due to the accumulation of round-off errors. For this reason, we recommend the use of full double precision or double/fixed precision. 
}

\DIFaddend The most common method to check for energy conservation is to systematically adjust the time step and plot the energy versus time. The energy should show little to no drift over the timescale of the simulation. Haile \cite{Haile1992} provides a detailed discussion of energy conservation and time step size (see Chapter 4.4 of his book). If constraints on bond lengths or angles are used, we also recommend checking to make sure that these constraints are maintained.

An important implicit assumption in Equations \ref{eq:Green-Kubo} and \ref{eq:Einstein} is that the time over which these expressions are evaluated is much larger than the correlation time of the variable $\xi$. This assumption is often satisfied easily for simple liquids, where relaxation times are fast, but becomes problematical for systems with sluggish dynamics. Therefore, insufficient simulation time is a common pitfall in estimating transport properties. To avoid this pitfall, we recommend performing a series of progressively longer simulations to determine if the estimated values deviate significantly with increasing simulation time. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Another way to test whether a simulation is long enough is to determine whether the molecules in the system explore a sufficiently diverse region of configuration space. This can be done by calculating the MSD of the molecules in the system and comparing this to either the radius of gyration of the largest molecule in the system (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$r_G$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$r_{\rm G}$}\DIFaddend ) or the box length ($L$). If the square root of the MSD is larger than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$r_G$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$r_{\rm G}$ }\DIFaddend (or better yet, is comparable to or larger than $L$), then the molecules have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{moved over long enough distances }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{traversed far enough }\DIFaddend to sample a significant amount of configuration space.

% Do we have a recommendation here for how to overcome this? Perhaps varying the simulation time to observe any change in the property value? -RAM

\subsection{General transport: Validation} \label{sec:General: Validation}

Validation is an important step to verify that the simulation set-up and post-simulation analysis are performed properly. One tool that can serve this purpose is the Standard Reference Simulation Website provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \cite{ShenSRSW}. ``Benchmark Simulation Results'' for static and transport properties are reported for both ``toy'' problems, such as the Lennard-Jones fluid, and more sophisticated systems, such as various water models, small \textit{n}-alkanes, and light gases. We recommend that novice users attempt to replicate the transport properties reported for some of these simple systems. Subsequently, we recommend attempting to replicate literature values reported for a similar system to the one of interest. In general, validation should be performed prior to simulating new systems for which a comparison is not possible.

\section{Self-diffusivity} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity}

We recommend the Einstein approach for computing self-diffusivity as it is robust and the most commonly used method. However, we also recommend validating that the Green-Kubo method provides similar estimates. Although systematic deviations are often observed between the two methods, if the analysis is done properly the values should agree within their statistical uncertainties \cite{Kondratyuk2016,Liu2012,Mondello1997}. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity General} discusses self-diffusivity checklist items that apply to both the Einstein and Green-Kubo approaches. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Sections }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Secs.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity Einstein} and \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity Green-Kubo} discuss checklist items that are specific to either the Einstein or Green-Kubo approaches, respectively, for estimating the self-diffusivity constant. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity Special topics} provides a brief discussion of some topics that are relevant in certain applications.

\subsection{Self-diffusivity: General} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity General}

%Here is a checklist of items specific to self-diffusivity that apply to both the Einstein and Green-Kubo approaches.

\subsubsection{Data analysis} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:General: Data analysis}

The equations for computing $D$ listed in Table~\ref{tab:EMD_equations} require the use of ``unwrapped coordinates''. That is, periodic boundary conditions should not be applied to the coordinates, or else the self-diffusivity will be underestimated. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend It is possible to use the coordinates / velocities of each atom or the center of mass of each molecule in the self-diffusivity expressions. In the long-time limit, the results should be the same (see Figures 1 and 2 of Ref. \cite{Mondello1997}). Nevertheless, we recommend using the molecular center of mass and not the individual atomic coordinates. The reason is that short-time vibrational displacements of individual atoms, that do not contribute to the self-diffusivity, are tracked when atomic coordinates are used while the center of mass displacements are much better behaved (see Figure 3 of Ref. \cite{Mondello1997}). In either case, it is imperative to use the correct value of $N$ (number of atoms or number of molecules) and to clearly state which approach \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend used.
%Does ``unwrapped coordinates'' require an explanation? Do most open-source simulation packages have the option to track ``unwrapped coordinates''? -ramess101

\subsubsection{Finite size effects} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:General: Finite size}

Finite size effects are significant for self-diffusivity calculations and must be accounted for to obtain meaningful estimates. Calculated self-diffusivities increase with increasing system size, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MoultosFig1} from Ref. \cite{Moultos2016} where the self-diffusivity of high pressure CO$_2$ differs by approximately 10~\% depending on the size of the system. We therefore stress the importance of reporting the self-diffusivity in the ``infinite" box limit. This can be determined in one of two ways. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{First, simulations are run }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The first approach is to perform simulations }\DIFaddend with progressively larger system sizes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{i.e., by increasing the number of molecules, $N$, and the box length, $L$, such that the density is constant. The }\DIFaddend computed self-diffusivities are \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then }\DIFaddend plotted as a function of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$1/N^{1/3}$, where $N$ is the number of molecules}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$N^{-1/3}$}\DIFaddend . As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MoultosFig1}, such a plot is approximately linear, and extrapolating to when \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$1/N^{1/3}=0$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$N^{-1/3}=0$ (i.e., $N \rightarrow \infty$) }\DIFaddend gives an estimate of the self-diffusivity (although note that some studies, such as Ref. \cite{Daivis:1995}, extrapolate $D$ with respect to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$1/N$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$N^{-1}$}\DIFaddend ). The downside of this approach is that it requires multiple simulations and the large system simulations are computationally intensive. 

The second approach is to estimate the infinite system self-diffusivity from a single simulation using an analytic correction factor proposed by Yeh and Hummer \cite{Yeh2004}. The correction is given by
\begin{equation}
	D_{\infty} = D(L) + \frac{k_{\rm B} T \xi}{6 \pi \eta L}
	\label{eq:YH-correction}
\end{equation}
where $D_\infty$ is the infinite system size self-diffusivity, $D(L)$ is the computed self-diffusivity for a cubic box with edge length $L$, $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant,
$T$ is the absolute temperature, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity, and $\xi = 2.837298$ is a dimensionless constant determined by an Ewald-like summation of a periodic lattice. The shear viscosity must be computed separately but fortunately, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\eta$ }\DIFaddend is not typically a strong function of system size (see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Viscosity:General: Finite size}). 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MoultosFig1}, both methods give similar results (compare the blue and red dashed lines). The advantage of the Yeh-Hummer correction is that a good estimate of the self-diffusivity can be obtained from a single simulation. Note that a different correction is required for non-cubic simulation boxes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kikugawa:2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kikugawa:2015}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend Also note that a different correction may be more appropriate for anisotropic condensed-phase systems (e.g., those containing membranes), discussed in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity Special topics}.

\subsection{Self-diffusivity: Einstein} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity Einstein}

%I think that we should have this just as a general Einstein approach section and then if anything is specific to Self-Diffusivity we move it to a new section -ramess101

\subsubsection{Output frequency} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Einstein: Output frequency}

Self-diffusivities are computed by post-processing a trajectory. For the Einstein self-diffusivity, this means the positions of the atoms (or molecule centers of mass) should be stored as a function of time so that the MSD can be computed. How often should one save positions and at what frequency? There will always be a trade-off between accuracy (which argues for more configurations saved more frequently) and file size or runtime performance (both of which argue for fewer configurations saved less frequently). Since the long-time slope in MSD is required in the Einstein approach, configurations do not need to be saved at a high frequency. As a general guideline, to balance file size and accuracy, we recommend that approximately 1000 independent configurations be saved at uniform time intervals over the length of a production run.

\subsubsection{Simulation length} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Einstein: Simulation length}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Simulation length needed depends on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The necessary simulation length depends on the }\DIFaddend number of molecules\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for which transport properties are desired. Fewer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, where fewer }\DIFaddend molecules require more simulation time and vice versa. %RAM: Is this a general statement, or just specific to self-diffusivity and Einstein?
Regardless, the simulation must be long enough so that the molecules are in the diffusive regime. We recommend computing the slope from a log-log plot of MSD with respect to time, which should be approximately 1 in the diffusive regime (see Figure \ref{fig:KondratyukFig2}). As mentioned in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:General: Common pitfalls}, another heuristic is whether the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{square root of the }\DIFaddend MSD is sufficiently large, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend larger than the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{square of the }\DIFdelend radius of gyration of the molecule at the low end and larger than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the square of }\DIFdelend half the box length at the high end. If these criteria are met, then one can have confidence that the diffusive regime has been sampled.

% One way of checking this is to create a log-log plot of MSD with respect to time . In the diffusive regime the slope of a log-The slope should be around 1. if the slope of a log-log plot of MSD vs. t = 1

\subsubsection{Data analysis} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Einstein: Data analysis}

In order to obtain reliable estimates of $D$, it is important to consider how the linear regression is performed for the MSD with respect to time (Equation 2). Specifically, the time interval that is included in the regression can have a significant impact on the predicted value of $D$. We recommend that only the ``middle'' of the MSD be used in the fit. Short time must be excluded as it follows a ballistic trajectory, while very long time is excluded due to the increased noise. Currently, we are unaware of an objective approach for defining the ``middle'' region. Until such an approach exists, we recommend that the author reports how the region was selected and how much variability in $D$ can be attributed to the choice of this region. In addition, the uncertainty in the fit of the slope should be reported. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A typical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{A typical log-log }\DIFaddend plot, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Kondratyuk2016}, is provided in Figure \ref{fig:KondratyukFig2}, where the linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{regressions at long time are included. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regression to the ``middle'' region is included. From visual inspection, the ``ballistic'' short-time interval ranges from the beginning of the simulation to approximately 100 ps. The ``middle'' region is identified by the linear regime with a slope of 1 (for a log-log plot) spanning from approximately 100 ps to 1000 ps. Note that the noisy ``long-time'' simulation data (beyond 1000 ps) are not depicted in Figure \ref{fig:KondratyukFig2} and are excluded from the linear fit.

%What about when the middle region is subdiffusive like in Figure \ref{fig:KondratyukFig2}?
%How do you fit the MSD (what time interval do you use?) Short time is ballistic trajectory; very long time you get noise, so you need to fit to the “middle” of the MSD.

\subsubsection{Output frequency} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Green-Kubo: Output frequency}

If the self-diffusivity is computed using a Green-Kubo approach, the velocities are needed as a function of time. Note that compared to the position information required by the Einstein approach, velocity information must be stored at a much higher frequency for the Green-Kubo approach. This is because the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) that must be integrated decays very rapidly and fine time resolution is needed to perform an accurate numerical integration. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For this reason, we }\DIFaddend recommend saving the velocities at least every 4 to 5 fs. Be warned that this will result in trajectory files that are significantly larger than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{positional trajectories }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the positional trajectories required for the Einstein approach, which are }\DIFaddend saved at lower frequencies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(see Sec.\ \ref{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Einstein: Output frequency}).
}\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Simulation length} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Green-Kubo: Simulation length}

Simulations should be long enough that the Green-Kubo integral has reached a plateau. Note that the plateau time is not the same as the required simulation time, since multiple time origins $(t_0)$ are used to compute the Green-Kubo integral. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ \ref{sec:Viscosity:General: Simulation length} provides a more thorough discussion of the relationship between the simulation time and the Green-Kubo plateau time.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Data analysis} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity:Green-Kubo: Data analysis}

The most common method for computing the self-diffusivity from the VACF is to do a direct numerical integration of the VACF. If this is done, the author should provide details on how the integration was carried out (numerical procedure, algorithm, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cutoffs}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cut-off times}\DIFaddend , etc.). The running integral versus time is calculated and the self-diffusivity is estimated from the plateau value. Note that when calculating the VACF, the maximum lag taken should be up to half the total simulation time, since longer times \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{serve to }\DIFdelend increase statistical noise. Also, note that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{long time }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{long-time }\DIFaddend ``tail'' of the VACF must be properly converged as it contributes significantly to the integral. As with the MSD, a cut-off \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{needs to be determined when deciding when }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{time is chosen to determine when }\DIFaddend the integral has converged. It is important to report how sensitive the estimate is to this cut-off time.

\subsection{Self-diffusivity: Special topics} \label{sec:Self-Diffusivity Special topics}

Although molecular simulation is well-suited for predicting diffusivity coefficients in membranes, several issues arise that require special attention. For example, the standard non-bonded long-range cut-off corrections are not straightforward in a heterogeneous system. For this reason, it is common to modify the non-bonded interactions such that tail corrections are not needed, e.g., cut-and-shift, force-switch \cite{GROMACS,Brooks2009}. However, it is important to investigate the impact modifying the non-bonded potential has on the diffusion coefficients. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Furthermore, since membranes require anisotropic pressure control it is important to use barostats/thermostats that maintain the correct isobaric/isothermal ensemble. Venable \textit{et al.} have shown that as long as a high-quality barostat and thermostat are used (such as those implemented via so-called "extended system" methods \cite{Nose1984,Hoover1985}), diffusion constants determined from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NVE and NPT }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$NVE$ and $NPT$ }\DIFaddend simulations are quite similar \cite{Venable2017}. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Finally, correcting diffusion coefficients for finite size effects (i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend when periodic boundary conditions are employed) in membrane systems requires some additional consideration. Camley \textit{et al.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{developed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{develop }\DIFaddend a method for determining diffusion constants in membrane systems which uses the immersed-boundary approach in the context of the the Saffman-Delbr{\"u}uck model \cite{Camley2015}. This method is available via \url{https://diffusion.lobos.nih.gov}.

%For systems that require anisotropic pressure control (e.g., membranes, etc.), use of a barostat/thermostat that maintains the correct isothermal/isobaric ensemble (e.g., extended system, Langevin piston) is required.

%Calculating diffusion in membrane systems with periodic boundary conditions require some additional consideration, e.g., Saffman-Delbruck model \cite{Camley2015,Venable2017}.

%The standard non-bonded long-range cut-off corrections are not straightforward when computing diffusivity in a heterogeneous system.

\section{Viscosity} \label{sec:Viscosity}

%Similar to self-diffusivity, EMD for viscosity is straightforward but its reliability compared to experimental data has not been evaluated with a comprehensive database. Many more experimental data are available for viscosity than for self-diffusivity. Anecdotal studies with small databases show encouraging results, but deviations from experiment can range from 5-35\% even when results are said to be “good.” Nieto-Draghi \textit{et al.} provide a useful review of the status quo \cite{Nieto2015}. EMD may deviate 2x more than NEMD from experimental data; hydrogen bonding throws in complications that may require empirical corrections.

% I don't think we want to talk about comparison to experimental data. We are not really concerned about if diffusivity or viscosity are accurately predicted relative to experiment, we just want to present the best methods for obtaining reproducible/honest results. In addition, you can predict viscosity more accurately if you parameterize your force field for such a purpose. -ramess101

Although the popularity of NEMD methods for predicting shear viscosity has increased in recent years, Ref. \cite{Chen2009} demonstrates that EMD methods can be of equal accuracy and reliability to NEMD as long as best practices are followed, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend proper system set-up and thorough data analysis. That being said, EMD works best for fluids with relatively low viscosity, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend typically less than 20 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ Pa-s\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend although EMD has been successfully implemented for systems near 50 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ Pa-s. Higher viscosity systems are extremely difficult to compute with EMD and so NEMD methods are often preferred in this case.

The recommended EMD approach for predicting viscosity is Green-Kubo. The Green-Kubo approach appears to be the most popular EMD method found in the literature and, more importantly, less arbitrary data analysis methods exist that improve the reliability and reproducibility (see Sec.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Viscosity:Green-Kubo: Data analysis}). 

We should note, however, that Ref. \cite{Hess2002} states that the Einstein relation is more convenient than Green-Kubo for viscosity because ``inaccuracies in the long-time correlations can be ignored by only considering \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{integral }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{integrals }\DIFaddend over shorter times.'' 
%What do we want to make of this claim? -RAM
Although this observation is true (see Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates}), several algorithmic advances have been implemented with the Green-Kubo approach since 2002 (when Ref. \cite{Hess2002} was published). Most of these improvements rely on performing large amounts of replicate simulations (see Sec.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Viscosity:General: Improved precision}). Therefore, we only recommend utilizing the Einstein approach when replicate simulations are too computationally expensive (see Sec.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Viscosity:Einstein: Data analysis}).

\subsection{Viscosity: General} \label{sec:Viscosity General}

\subsubsection{Output frequency} \label{sec:Viscosity:General: Output frequency}

As with the self-diffusivity, shear viscosity is computed by post processing a data file. If the Green-Kubo procedure is used, stress tensor components need to be written out frequently enough so that an accurate estimate of the time integral can be made. Since the integral decays quickly with time, we recommend writing the stress tensor every 5 to 10 fs. If the Einstein relationship is used, less frequent writes can be made over the length of the simulation. The user should perform some preliminary tests to ensure write frequencies are sufficient as well as to estimate file sizes for a given simulation.

\subsubsection{Simulation length} \label{sec:Viscosity:General: Simulation length}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Overall you need }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Since viscosity is a collective property, i.e., the stress tensor depends on all $N$ molecules, }\DIFaddend about ten times more data \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are required }\DIFaddend to compute viscosity than diffusivity\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, since viscosity is a collective property}\DIFdelend . As with the self-diffusivity, the simulation time needs to be long enough so that all the relaxation processes are adequately sampled. We recommend applying similar heuristics as those described in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section~}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Sec.\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:General: Common pitfalls} to determine the length of the simulation required.

Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig8}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Zhang2015}, demonstrates that if the length of each independent trajectory is too short the viscosity will not converge to the correct value, regardless of how many replicates are used. Specifically, the average viscosity obtained from 100 replicates of 500 ps appears to diverge from the 1, 2, and 4 ns simulation results, suggesting that 500 ps is not sufficiently long for this system. Since it is very hard to know how long an individual trajectory needs to be \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{a priori}}\DIFaddend , we recommend performing an analysis similar to that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ZhangFig8} to ensure adequate sampling.

It is important not to confuse the Green-Kubo integration time (the abscissa for the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig8}) with the simulation length (the different color lines in both panels of Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig8}). Recall that the Green-Kubo integral (plotted in the top panel) is evaluated using multiple time origins $(t_0)$, so the Green-Kubo integral contains more independent trajectories for the 4 ns line than the 500 ps line. Therefore, the time at which the Green-Kubo integral reaches a plateau (around 100 ps in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig8}) is not the same as the required simulation time. For sufficient independent trajectories, the required simulation time should typically be around an order of magnitude greater than the plateau time.

Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig10}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Zhang2015}, demonstrates that the plateau time increases with increasing viscosity, where an order of magnitude increase in viscosity corresponds to approximately an order of magnitude increase in the plateau time. In order to account for the increase in the plateau time, higher viscosity fluids require longer overall simulation times.

\subsubsection{Improved precision}	\label{sec:Viscosity:General: Improved precision}

To improve statistical averaging, it is common to include multiple terms from the stress tensor. For example, Figure \ref{fig:HessFig5}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Hess2002}, demonstrates the improvement of averaging the three off-diagonal elements of the pressure tensor, compared to a single off-diagonal element. To maximize simulation efficiency for an isotropic system, we recommend that users employ a generalized form of the Green-Kubo integral \citep{Evans:90, Daivis:1994}, which uses all six independent components of the stress tensor. Details are given in the Appendix of Ref. \cite{Daivis:1994}. This generalized integral is given by
\begin{equation}
  \eta = \frac{V}{10 k_{\rm B} T}  \int_0^\infty \left\langle \tau_{ij}^{\rm os}(0)\tau_{ij}^{\rm os}(t) \right\rangle_{t_0} dt
  \label{eq:GKwonder}
\end{equation}
where the components $\tau_{ij}^{\rm os}$ of the traceless, symmetric part of the stress tensor are given by
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{ij}^{\rm os} = \frac{\tau_{ij}+\tau_{ji}}{2} - \delta_{ij} \left( \frac{1}{3} \sum_k \tau_{kk} \right)
  \label{eq:Pwonder}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the unit tensor. Note that the factor of 10 in the denominator of Equation~\ref{eq:GKwonder} results from assigning weighting factors of 3/3 and 4/3 for each of the six off-diagonal terms and the three diagonal terms, respectively \cite{Liu2012,Borodin2009,Mondello1997} (although some authors have argued for an equal weighting \cite{Chen2009}, which would modify the normalization factor in the denominator of Equation~\ref{eq:GKwonder}).
% from a 3/3 contribution from each of the six off-diagonal terms plus an implicit 4/3 contribution from each of the three diagonal terms. 
The equivalent generalization of the Einstein relation is
\begin{equation}
  \eta = \frac{V}{20 k_{\rm B} T} \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{d}{dt} \sum_i \sum_j \left\langle \int_0^t \tau_{ij}^{\rm os}(t') dt' \right\rangle_{t_0}
  \label{eq:Einwonder}
\end{equation}

We are not aware of any studies that rigorously quantify the improvement in precision obtained by using all six terms. Figure \ref{fig:ChenFig1}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Chen2009}, demonstrates that the average viscosity and fluctuations are nearly identical when using the three off-diagonal terms or when using six terms. Therefore, although we recommend including all six terms, it is typically sufficient to utilize just the three off-diagonal terms. Regardless, it is important to clearly state which terms are included when computing viscosity.

\end{figure}

Although fluctuations in $\eta$ are significantly reduced by including multiple terms from the stress tensor, the key to improved precision of viscosity estimates is to average several replicate simulations. For $N_{\rm reps}$ replicates, the Green-Kubo equation is
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{V}{10 k_{\rm B} T N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm reps}}  \int_0^\infty \left\langle \tau_{ij,n}^{\rm os}(0)\tau_{ij,n}^{\rm os}(t) \right\rangle_{t_0} dt
\label{eq:GKwonder_replicates}
\end{equation}
and the Einstein relation becomes
\begin{equation}
\eta = \displaystyle \frac{V}{20 k_{\rm B} T N_{\rm reps}} \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{d}{dt} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm reps}} \sum_i \sum_j \left\langle \int_0^t \tau_{ij,n}^{\rm os}(t') dt' \right\rangle_{t_0}
\label{eq:Einwonder_replicates}
\end{equation}

For example, Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates} demonstrates that averaging three stress tensors is not sufficient to obtain a reliable Einstein slope as $t \to \infty$. By contrast, a near linear trend at high time is observed by averaging a large number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(30) of replicates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of replicates $(N_{\rm reps} = 30)$}\DIFaddend .

The number of replicates used in the literature varies widely. In their study of the shear viscosity of alkanes, Payal and co-workers \cite{Payal2012} used 10 replicates, whereas Zhang \textit{et al.} \cite{Zhang2015} performed a systematic investigation of the minimal number of replicates required for convergence. They observed that a value of 30 to 40 replicates was statistically equivalent to 100 replicates for their system. However, the necessary number of replicates depends on the system. Specifically, the compound, the temperature, the number of molecules, and the simulation time all influence the optimal number of replicates. We recommend that researchers plot how $\eta$ varies with respect to the number of replicates for a range of 10 to 30 replicates to determine if additional simulations are needed.

%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Simulation length: overall you need about 10X more data to compute viscosity than diffusivity, since viscosity is a collective property. Also requires sufficient simulation time for “4-5 molecular rotations” on average.
%	% Do we have any literature to support this? -ramess101
%	\item Output frequency should be high (every 5-10 fs); this needs to be checked for the particular system.

More work needs to be done to verify this. We recommend that users look for system size effects by plotting the viscosity with respect to $N^{-1/3}$, where $N$ is the number of molecules. The range of $N$ should span an order of magnitude or, if this is computationally intractable, at least a factor of two. The author should report any dependence observed for viscosity with respect to system size. If a linear trend is observed with respect to $N^{-1/3}$, the infinite system size viscosity can be extrapolated as the intercept from a linear regression. The author should report the uncertainty associated with this linear fit and extrapolation.

\subsubsection{Data analysis} \label{sec:Viscosity:Green-Kubo: Data analysis}

It is imperative to report how the viscosity was estimated from Equation \ref{eq:Green-Kubo}. There are three common methods: average over a specified time interval, fit the autocorrelation function to a model and analytically integrate the model fit, or fit the ``running integral'' to a model and extrapolate the model to infinite time. We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recommend the latter methodology but }\DIFdelend discuss each approach below \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{but recommend the latter methodology as it requires fewer arbitrary user decisions and is more robust than the other two methods}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection*{Average over time interval}

A slightly ambiguous but common practice is to report an average shear viscosity that is obtained over a specified time interval. Due to large fluctuations at long times, the initial plateau of the integral at short times (around 10 to 100 ps) is typically the region of choice, see Refs. \cite{Fanourgakis2012,Chen2009}. However, it is important to explain how this time interval was selected (e.g., visual inspection, test of convergence, magnitude of fluctuations) and to quantify how much the estimated viscosity changes if the time interval were modified. For example, in Figures \ref{fig:HessFig5} and \ref{fig:ChenFig1} the reported viscosity would likely be the average from approximately 5 to 15 ps and 10 to 25 dimensionless time units, respectively. Clearly, the estimated viscosity would vary significantly if the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{average included }\DIFaddend long-time data\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were included in the average}\DIFdelend . 

\subsubsection*{Model fit to autocorrelation function}

An alternative method is to fit a model to the autocorrelation function before calculating the ``running integral.'' The integral of the model fit can then be evaluated in the limit as $t \to \infty$. This helps to overcome large fluctuations at long times and, thereby, reduces uncertainties. The primary difficulty is finding a model that can adequately match the autocorrelation function without introducing bias into the estimate of viscosity. A common function found in the literature is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GROMACS,GUANG2002}
}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend \begin{equation} \label{eq:ACF_fit}
\frac{S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}(t)}{S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}(0)} = (1-C)\cos(\omega t)\exp{(-t/\tau_f)^{\beta_f}} + C\exp{(-t/\tau_s)^{\beta_s}}
\end{equation}
where $C, \omega, \tau_f, \tau_s, \beta_f, \beta_s$ (and sometimes $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}(0)$) are fitting parameters. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Specifically, }\DIFaddend $\omega$ is the frequency of rapid pressure oscillations, $\tau_f$ and $\beta_f$ are the time constant and exponent of fast relaxation in a stretched-exponential approximation, $\tau_s$ and $\beta_s$ are constants for slow relaxation, $C$ is the pre-factor that determines the weight between fast and slow relaxation, $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}(t)$ is the stress autocorrelation function at time $t$, and $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}(0)$ is the initial (time-zero) autocorrelation function\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GROMACS}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend .

%Figure \ref{fig:FanourgakisFig1}, from Ref.  \cite{Fanourgakis2012}, demonstrates that Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} can reliably fit the autocorrelation function for this system. However, small deviations in the model fit can lead to significant bias in the estimated viscosity. Similar to the methods discussed previously, it is important to quantify the variability in viscosity that arises from the model fit. For example, we recommend bootstrapping the uncertainties of the model fit. Furthermore, if a weighting function or cut-off time is implemented when fitting Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit}, the impact of these parameters should be discussed.

Figure \ref{fig:FanourgakisFig1}, from Ref. \cite{Fanourgakis2012}, demonstrates that Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} has the correct shape to fit the stress autocorrelation function for this system. However, notice the significant deviation between the model fit $(S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF})$ and the raw simulation output $(S_{\rm ACF})$ for time less than 0.02 ps and the relatively small deviations in the first two peaks around 0.1 ps. These systematic deviations in the model fit can lead to significant bias in the estimated viscosity. One method to overcome this issue is to place a larger weight on short-time data or to include a cut-off time beyond which $S_{\rm ACF}$ data are not included in the model fit.

%DIF < Recall that the main purpose for fitting $S_{\rm ACF}$ to a model (Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit}) is so that the long-time Green-Kubo integration converges, i.e. so that $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$ converges to zero as $t \to \infty$. For this reason, it is sometimes preferred to only fit $S_{\rm ACF}$ data after a given time, specifically, after the ``fast'' autocorrelation component has dissipated (the first term in Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} and the red dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:FanourgakisFig1}). In other words, the Green-Kubo integration is performed using the raw $S_{\rm ACF}$ simulation output for short time and then $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$ is used to integrate the Green-Kubo integral to infinite time.

For this reason, it is sometimes preferred to only fit $S_{\rm ACF}$ data after a given time, specifically, after the ``fast'' autocorrelation component has dissipated (the first term in Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} and the red dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:FanourgakisFig1}). In other words, the Green-Kubo integration is performed using the raw $S_{\rm ACF}$ simulation output for short time and then $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$ is used to integrate the Green-Kubo integral to infinite time. 

Alternatively, it is sometimes preferable to integrate the raw $S_{\rm ACF}$ simulation output for short time and then integrate the model fit, $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$, to infinite time \cite{vanderSpoel1998,Shirts2013,Fernandez2005}. The advantage of this hybrid (combined) integration approach is that the raw data are used in the time region where small deviations in the model fit can lead to large biases in $\eta$, whereas the model fit is utilized in the time region where integration of the raw data does not converge. The hybrid integration approach is especially preferred when $S_{\rm ACF}$ is highly oscillatory, such as that shown in Figure 7 of Ref. \cite{Fernandez2005}, where Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} is likely inadequate. 

The time where the Green-Kubo integration switches from using $S_{\rm ACF}$ to $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$, referred to as the switch-time $(t_{\rm s})$, should be after the ``fast'' autocorrelation component has dissipated (the first term in Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} and the red dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:FanourgakisFig1}). As this time depends on the system and user judgment, examples of $t_{\rm s}$ in the literature range widely. For example, $t_{\rm s} = 5$ ps in Refs. \cite{vanderSpoel1998,Shirts2013} while the switch-time value is only 0.015 ps in Ref. \cite{Fernandez2005}.  

A simpler exponential decay function than Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit} can be used with the hybrid integration approach because the model does not need to fit the autocorrelation function over the entire time range, just for $t > t_{\rm s}$. For example, it is common to fit $S_{\rm ACF}$ values for $t > t_{\rm s}$ to a single exponential term, e.g., $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF} = \exp(-(t/\tau)^\beta)$ \cite{vanderSpoel1998}, $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF} = \exp(-t/\tau)$ \cite{Shirts2013}, or $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF} = a \exp(-t/b)$ \cite{Fernandez2005}, where $\tau$, $\beta$, $a$, and $b$ are fitting parameters. 

%The hybrid integration approach is especially preferred when $S_{\rm ACF}$ is highly oscillatory, such as that shown in Figure \ref{fig:FernandezFig7}, from Ref. \cite{Fernandez2005}. The dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:FernandezFig7} is obtained by fitting the $S_{\rm ACF}$ data (denoted $\Phi_{\eta}(t)$) for $t > 0.015$ ps to the model $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF} = a \exp(-t/b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are fitting parameters. Note that a simpler exponential decay function can be used with the hybrid integration approach because the model does not need to fit the autocorrelation function over the entire time range, just for $t > t_{\rm s}$.

%The value of 0.015 ps is referred to as the switch-time, namely, the time where the Green-Kubo integration switches from using $S_{\rm ACF}$ to $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$.

Similar to the methods discussed previously, it is important to quantify the variability in viscosity that arises from the model fit. For example, we recommend bootstrapping the uncertainties by repeating the model fit for hundreds of randomly selected subsets of $S_{\rm ACF}$. If the hybrid integration approach is utilized, it is important to investigate and report how sensitive the final viscosity value is to the switch-time and/or to discuss how $t_{\rm s}$ is chosen. Furthermore, if a weighting function or cut-off time is implemented when fitting $S^{\rm f}_{\rm ACF}$, the impact of these parameters should be discussed.

\subsubsection*{Model fit to running integral}

The method we recommend for obtaining viscosity from EMD is to fit an analytic function directly to the ``running integral''. The primary advantage of fitting a model to the ``running integral'' over the previous approach of fitting a model to the autocorrelation function (i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit}) is that uncertainties in the model fit do not propagate through the integration. 

For example, Refs. \cite{ReyCastro2006} and \cite{Zhang2015} recommend fitting the ``running integral'' to a double-exponential function \begin{equation} \label{eq: Double exponential}
\eta(t) = A \alpha \tau_1 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_1)}\right) + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_2)}\right)
\end{equation}
where $A, \alpha, \tau_1, $ and $\tau_2$ are fitting parameters. Note that the ``true'' estimate of $\eta$ is obtained as $t \to \infty$, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend $\eta_\infty = A \alpha \tau_1 + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2$. 

Ref. \cite{Borodin2009} proposes an alternative model by integrating the slow stretched-exponential function (second term in Equation \ref{eq:ACF_fit}) which results in the expression
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Borodin}
\eta(t) = \eta_\infty (1- \exp(-(t/\tau_s)^{\beta_s}))
\end{equation}
where $\eta_\infty$, $\tau_s$, and $\beta_s$ are fitting parameters that relate to the infinite-time viscosity, decay time, and the exponent of slow relaxation. 

We recommend the use of Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} as we have found it to be a more flexible fitting model, i.e.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the optimized sum-squared-error is typically lower than that of Equation \ref{eq:Borodin}. That being said, the $\eta_{\infty}$ estimates obtained with Equations \ref{eq: Double exponential} and \ref{eq:Borodin} are quite similar. Deviations in $\eta_{\infty}$ between the two equations are generally less than 1~\% for both low (gas phase) and high (compressed liquid phase) viscosities. Regardless of whether Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} or \ref{eq:Borodin} is implemented, it is important to include a description of how the fit is performed, e.g., the objective function, range of data included.

Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} recommends that the data be weighted by the inverse of the standard deviation $(\sigma)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from the replicate simulation values. As $\sigma$ increases significantly }\DIFaddend with respect to time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. They }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, Ref. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Zhang2015} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend fit $\sigma$ to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend model $A t^b$, where $t$ is time and $A$ and $b$ are fitting parameters. This fit is used to develop a weighting model of the form $w \propto t^{-b}$, where $w$ is the weight and $b$ is the weighting exponent obtained from the $\sigma$ model fit. If such a model is utilized, the resulting estimate of $\eta$ may depend strongly on $b$, the weighting exponent. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend For example, Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig7_12}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Zhang2015}, compares $\eta$ for two different values of $b$ in the weighting model, namely, when $b$ is a predetermined value of 0.5 and when $b$ is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fit to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{obtained from the }\DIFaddend $\sigma$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the replicate averages}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fit}\DIFaddend . Note that Ref. \cite{ReyCastro2006} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recommended }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{recommends }\DIFaddend a value of $b=2$. Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{demonstrated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{demonstrates }\DIFaddend that for $b=2$ the estimated value of $\eta$ for an ionic liquid ([BMIM][Tf$_2$N]) at 350 K is approximately 11 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ Pa-s (compared to $\approx$ 19 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ Pa-s in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig7_12}). 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend For these reasons, we recommend that the author quantifies the uncertainty in the estimated viscosity due to the value of $b$. Propagating the uncertainty in $\eta$ from $b$ can be accomplished by implementing a two-step bootstrap method. First, a distribution of $b$ values are obtained by bootstrapping the $\sigma$ model fit. Second, a distribution of $\eta$ values are computed by fitting Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} with each value of $b$ from the distribution generated in the previous step.

%Figure 13 of Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} shows that the estimated value of $\eta$ for [BMIM][Tf$_2$N] at 350 K (corresponding to the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig7_12}) is approximately 11 cP utilizing the value of $b=2$ recommended by Ref. \cite{ReyCastro2006}.

	\label{fig:ZhangFig7_12}
\end{figure}

Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} also suggests that a cut-off time be implemented to improve the fit. They provide a heuristic that the cut-off time correspond to when the standard deviation is 40~\% of the plateau value. Regardless of how the cut-off is determined, it is important to quantify the degree to which the estimated viscosity depends on this parameter. For example, Zhang \textit{et al.} reported that the viscosity decreased by 0.8~\% and 6.1~\% when using a cut-off time corresponding to a standard deviation of 30~\% or 20~\% the plateau value, respectively. However, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{since }\DIFaddend the magnitude of variability depends strongly on the system\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, we }\DIFaddend recommend that the author quantify the cut-off time dependence.

Furthermore, Ref. \cite{Zhang2015} recommends excluding short-time data from the fitting procedure. In Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig4}, borrowed from Ref. \cite{Zhang2015}, we observe large oscillations at very short times, \textit{ca.} $t < 2$ ps. A weighting function with a $t^{-b}$ form assigns an inappropriately large weight to these short-time data points. Therefore, it is important to exclude data in this short-time region from the model fitting.

For example, Zhang \textit{et al.} reported that the viscosity decreased by 0.8\% and 6.1\% when using a cut-off time corresponding to a standard deviation of 30\% or 20\% the plateau value, respectively. However, the magnitude of variability depends strongly on the system. We recommend that the author demonstrate the cut-off time dependence. For example, plots of the estimated viscosity with respect to the weighting exponent and cut-off time, such as those shown in Figure \ref{fig:GK_tcut_b}, provide a quantitative measure of confidence in the viscosity value.

%\subsubsection{Improved precision} \label{sec:Viscosity:Einstein: Improved precision}
%
%%Similar to the Green-Kubo approach for viscosity, the key to obtaining precise estimates with the Einstein approach is to average multiple replicate simulations.
%
%DIF < The viscosity with respect to time is estimated from the slope of the Einstein integral. Thus, the average of replicates can be performed in one of two ways. The first option is to calculate the viscosity (i.e. the slope) with respect to time for each replicate and then average the replicate viscosities. However, this approach results in large fluctuations and, therefore, large uncertainties. The second, and recommended, method is to average the Einstein integral of the multiple replicates. The resulting Einstein integral is often linear over a large time interval if sufficient replicates are used. Subsequently, the slope is determined from this average Einstein integral. Fortunately, with sufficient replicate simulations the slope tends to be fairly constant over intermediate and long-time intervals. The number of replicates needed has not been rigorously investigated as it has for the Green-Kubo approach. For this reason, we recommend creating a plot of viscosity with respect to number of replicates (see Figure \ref{fig:ZhangFig8}) to determine when sufficient replicates have been simulated. It is our experience that the necessary number of replicates is similar to that for Green-Kubo. As recommended for Green-Kubo, we also recommend bootstrapping the uncertainty. This is done by randomly sampling which replicates are included in the average Einstein integral, calculating the viscosity from the slope, and producing a distribution of these viscosity values from thousands of different random sets of replicates.

\subsubsection{Data analysis} \label{sec:Viscosity:Einstein: Data analysis}

%Similar to the Einstein approach for self-diffusivity, in general, the initial time should be discarded. Since the Einstein relation is valid in the limit of infinite time, it is common to fit the slope at long time. However, it is also common to fit the slope to an intermediate time interval. We recommend that the author explain why the slope was calculated using a given time interval and how much variability is introduced if a different region is selected. For example, similar to the bootstrap method discussed in Sec.\ \ref{sec:General: Uncertainty}, a useful measure of uncertainty would be the range of $\eta$ values obtained by analyzing numerous (order of 100) different time regions.

Since the Einstein relation is valid in the limit of infinite time, in theory the slope should only be computed at long time. Unfortunately, by contrast with self-diffusivity, the long-time trend from a single run is often non-linear (recall Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates}). Replicate simulations are typically necessary to obtain a well-behaved long-time trend. For example, Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates} demonstrates that the replicate-averaged Einstein integral is approximately linear over a large time interval (using 30 replicate simulations). Therefore, if sufficient replicates are used it is possible to compute a reliable slope (viscosity) at the long-time limit.

However, as observed in the inset of Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates}, the Einstein integral becomes nearly linear for a single simulation after a few ps. For these reasons, it is common to fit the slope from a single simulation over an intermediate time interval, e.g., 5 to 50 ps. We only recommend calculating the slope from an intermediate time interval if performing a large number of replicate simulations is too computationally expensive. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Also, as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As }\DIFaddend mentioned in Sec.\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:Viscosity}, the Einstein approach is likely preferred over the Green-Kubo approach only in this scenario. With a single simulation (or a small number of replicate simulations), we recommend that the author explain why the slope was calculated using a given intermediate time interval and how much variability is introduced if a different region is selected. 

For example, Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_slope_time_interval} helps visualize the uncertainty in $\eta$ due to the time interval used to compute the slope. Panels a) and b) are obtained from the respective single and 30 replicate simulation results presented previously in Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates}. Panel a) demonstrates that determining $\eta$ from a single run depends strongly on the time interval, while Panel b) shows that $\eta$ is much less dependent on the time interval when obtained from 30 replicate simulations.

The replicate-averaged Einstein integral is often linear over a large time interval if sufficient replicates are used (see Figure \ref{fig:Einstein_3terms_30replicates}). Therefore, a reliable slope (viscosity) can be computed at the long-time limit, rather than arbitrarily computing the slope at shorter times.

\subsection{Viscosity: Special topics} \label{sec:Viscosity Special topics}

The GROMACS manual reports that viscosity ``is very dependent on the treatment of the electrostatics. Using a (short) cut-off results in large noise on the off-diagonal pressure elements, which can increase the calculated viscosity by an order of magnitude.'' \cite{GROMACS,Hess2002} Therefore, when computing viscosities for systems with electrostatics, it is extremely important to investigate the effect of cut-off distance. This can be done by performing simulations with variable Coulombic cut-off lengths, typically 0.9, 1.2, and 1.4 nm. We also recommend investigating whether the estimated viscosity depends strongly on the algorithm for computing the electrostatics, e.g., particle mesh Ewald. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GROMACS,Darden1993} 
}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend 

Similarly, we suspect that the viscosity also depends on the van der Waals cut-off length and/or if a cut-and-shift, force-switch, or truncated (with or without tail corrections) potential is implemented \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GROMACS}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{GROMACS,Levitt1995,derSpoel2006}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

\section{Conclusions} \label{Conclusions}
%RAM: I have commented out DJC original conclusion section, and copied a slightly modified version
%Molecular simulation is commonly used to predict transport properties, however, without careful simulation design and acute analysis, results may not be meaningful. For example, an EMD simulation with an insufficient number of molecules can severely underestimate self-diffusivity. This work outlines the best practices in the design and analysis of MD simulations for transport properties.
%
%For self-diffusivity, it is suggested that the Einstein method is employed. In liquid systems, the NVE ensemble is suggested over the NVT ensemble due to the potential interference of the thermostats in self-diffusivity prediction. Uncertainty is reduced by running multiple independent simulations, allowing for a more thorough sampling of the system's possible states. Multiple runs at different system sizes can be used to extrapolate the infinite system size limit prediction for self-diffusivity. Atom positions are recommended to be outputted 1000 times over a production run, however, the user can choose to output less frequently to reduce file size or more frequently for potentially increased accuracy. To ensure simulations are run long enough for the dynamics of the system to be fully emulated, the user can run a series of simulations at differing lengths, and observe deviation in estimated self-diffusivity with changes in simulation time. The system's degree of exploration of configuration space can be estimated by calculating the MSD of the molecules and comparing it to the radius of gyration and box length. The MSD should be greater than the radius of gyration, and ideally, on the order of the box length. In post-simulation analysis, best practice improves precision by averaging the velocity autocorrelation function over all molecules and over multiple time origins. Some judgment by the user is necessary to decide where the slope is measured for the Einstein approach, and it is important that the user communicate the approach used and justify how the decision was made. Measures should be taken to rigorously estimate the precision of the self-diffusivity prediction, a method of bootstrapping these uncertainties is detailed in this work.
%
%DIF < For viscosity, the Green-Kubo approach is recommended, although the Einstein method may be preferred with certain systems. It is worth noting that NEMD simulations are highly preferred for moderate to high viscosity materials (more than 20 cP or so). The NVE ensemble is suggested, but some success has been found using the NVT ensemble \cite{Shirts2013,Fanourgakis2012}. Because it is a collective property, viscosity requires significantly more data than self-diffusivity. The simulation length of each trajectory should typically be at least an order of magnitude greater than the Green-Kubo integral plateau time. This can be more precisely determined by comparing the Green-Kubo integrals of varying simulation lengths. Due to their slower dynamics, more viscous materials require longer simulation times. Stress tensor components are recommended to be outputted every 5 to 10 fs. System size seems to be of little impact on viscosity prediction (see Figures \ref{fig:MoultosFig3}-\ref{fig:ZhangFig9}), however, it is still recommended that the user justify their choice of system size by plotting $N^{-1/3}$ versus predicted viscosity. Any trend observed would suggest system size effects, and an infinite system size result could be estimated from a linear fit. In post-simulation data processing, it is recommended to average over all six independent components of the stress tensor to enhance precision. The number of replicates a system needs can vary greatly depending on the compound, number of molecules, temperature, and simulation length. Replicates required can be investigated by plotting variance in viscosity versus number of replicates (on the order of 10 to 30), wherein a trend may indicate that more replicates are needed. It is recommended that the viscosity is estimated from the Green-Kubo equation by fitting the running integral to a double-exponential function as specified by Zhang \textit{et al.} \cite{Zhang2015} (see Section \ref{sec:Viscosity:Green-Kubo: Data analysis}).

%The focus of the current work is outlining best practices in EMD for self-diffusivity and viscosity prediction. This work may be expanded on in the future with NEMD techniques or best practices for other transport properties.
